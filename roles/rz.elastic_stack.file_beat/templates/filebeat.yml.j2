#============================== Kibana =====================================

# Starting with Beats version 6.0.0, the dashboards are loaded via the Kibana API.
# This requires a Kibana endpoint configuration.
setup.kibana:

  # Kibana Host
  # Scheme and port can be left out and will be set to the default (http and 5601)

  #ssl.enabled: true

  # Configure SSL verification mode. If `none` is configured, all server hosts
  # and certificates will be accepted. In this mode, SSL based connections are
  # susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. Use only for testing. Default is
  # `full`.

#============================== Dashboards =====================================
# These settings control loading the sample dashboards to the Kibana index. Loading
# the dashboards are disabled by default and can be enabled either by setting the
# options here, or by using the `-setup` CLI flag or the `setup` command.
setup.dashboards.enabled: {{beat.setup.dashboards.enabled}}

# The URL from where to download the dashboards archive. It is used instead of
# the directory if it has a value.

# The file archive (zip file) from where to read the dashboards. It is used instead
# of the directory when it has a value.

# select which one to load. You can load all the dashboards in the archive by
# setting this to the empty string.

# The name of the Kibana index to use for setting the configuration. Default is ".kibana"
#setup.dashboards.kibana_index: .kibana

# The Elasticsearch index name. This overwrites the index name defined in the
# dashboards and index pattern. Example: testbeat-*
#setup.dashboards.index:

# Always use the Kibana API for loading the dashboards instead of autodetecting
# how to install the dashboards by first querying Elasticsearch.

# it will retry to reconnect to Kibana instead of exiting with an error.

#================================ Logging =====================================

# Sets log level. The default log level is info.
# Available log levels are: error, warning, info, debug
#logging.level: debug

# At debug level, you can selectively enable logging only for some components.
# To enable all selectors use ["*"]. Examples of other selectors are "beat",
# "publish", "service".
#logging.selectors: ["*"]

#============================== Xpack Monitoring ===============================
# filebeat can export internal metrics to a central Elasticsearch monitoring
# cluster.  This requires xpack monitoring to be enabled in Elasticsearch.  The
# reporting is disabled by default.

# Set to true to enable the monitoring reporter.
#xpack.monitoring.enabled: false

# Uncomment to send the metrics to Elasticsearch. Most settings from the
# Elasticsearch output are accepted here as well. Any setting that is not set is
# automatically inherited from the Elasticsearch output configuration, so if you
# have the Elasticsearch output configured, you can simply uncomment the
# following line.
